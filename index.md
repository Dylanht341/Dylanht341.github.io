### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
Lab 5 was a favorite due to the mathematical aspect of it. Learning and
being able to work with arithmetic within code was very insightful and
acts as a basis for what otjer code I may write in the future. All in
all, this lab was one of the most impactful, yet fun, labs that I have
done.

* Lab 7
I especially enjoyed Lab 7 due to the second part where I was able to
work with functions. I believe that this was the first lab that covered
functions. Due to this, the lab plays a huge role in influencing the way
I write code now.

* Lab 10
Lab 10 was a very memorable lab. It was one of the first labs where we
learned to work with .h files and classes such as Magick. In part 3, we
created an image of a gradient. Being the first image we created using
code, it was especially exciting due to the discovery that I was able to
do such a thing.
